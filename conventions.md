# Conventions

## Transcribing issues

We are not interested in the precise representation of the texts in the physical documents. Therefore we transcribe the text without hyphenation.

Pagebreaks are of interest, they are included in the running text.

Encoding references/links not with attribute "ref", instead use "tei:idno", e.g. 
``` xml
<idno type="URL">http://url.to/link</idno> 
```

## Entities issues

### Persons

For the internal identifier use "surname_firstname".

### Works

For the internal identifiers use "shorttitle_surnamefirstauthor".
